  Specify your Jabber/XMPP ID, like <tt>john.smith@jabber.org</tt>

  <p>
  The <tt>@jabber.org</tt> portion identifies you in the Jabber network. This information is also
  used to determine the server to connect to (see
  <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3920.html#rfc.section.14.3">RFC3920</a> for the exact look up process.)
  <p>
  If your XMPP server is not available via service name lookup via DNS - e.g. if you're using Google Talk and your Google address
  doesn't end in @gmail.com - then you must additionally specify the XMPP server name in the Advanced section.
